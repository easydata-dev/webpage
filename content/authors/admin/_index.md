I am a skilled Data Engineer with over 12 years of experience in software engineering and data pipeline development. My current focus is on refactoring ETL libraries, maintaining large-scale data pipelines, and managing data warehouse solutions using Pyspark, AWS, Airflow, and Databricks.

Previously, I played a key role in developing global software for television audience measurement using Spark and AWS. I also have extensive experience in low-level system programming, including building automated testing frameworks, optimizing algorithms for embedded systems, and contributing to kernel module development.

Earlier in my career, I specialized in firmware development and embedded Linux systems, with experience ranging from Bluetooth processors to Android software development.

My core strengths include Python AWS, Spark, and end-to-end system performance optimization across diverse platforms.
